This project was done by Katlego R Phele and Tshegofatso K Maboela. We initiated this idea after approaching a few local businesses and we have seen that they lack a digital presence.
Here are some key reasons why having exposure through a digital presence is advantageous for businesses:

Wider Reach: Establishing a digital presence allows businesses to reach a broader audience beyond their immediate physical location. It opens up opportunities to attract customers from different regions, cities, or even countries.

24/7 Availability: A website or social media presence is available to potential customers 24/7. This means that even when the physical store is closed, people can still learn about the business, browse products or services, and make inquiries.

Credibility and Trust: A well-designed website and active social media profiles can enhance a business's credibility. Consumers often research products or services online before making a purchase, and having an online presence can instill trust in potential customers.

Marketing and Advertising: Digital platforms offer numerous marketing and advertising opportunities. Businesses can utilize social media advertising, email marketing, content marketing, and search engine optimization (SEO) to promote their products or services to a targeted audience.

Cost-Effective: Compared to traditional advertising methods, digital marketing is often more cost-effective. It allows businesses to allocate their budget more efficiently and measure the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns in real-time.

Customer Engagement: Social media and online communities provide businesses with a platform to engage with their customers directly. This engagement can lead to valuable feedback, brand loyalty, and the ability to address customer concerns promptly.

Competitive Advantage: In today's digital age, many consumers expect businesses to have an online presence. A business that embraces digital technology can gain a competitive edge over competitors who neglect this aspect.

Data and Analytics: Digital platforms provide access to valuable data and analytics. Businesses can gain insights into customer behavior, preferences, and trends, which can inform decision-making and improve products or services.

E-commerce Opportunities: An online presence can enable businesses to sell products or services online, reaching customers who prefer the convenience of online shopping.

Adaptability: The digital landscape is ever-evolving, and businesses that establish an online presence demonstrate their adaptability to changing consumer preferences and technological advancements.

Global Expansion: For businesses with global aspirations, the internet offers a pathway to expand internationally, attracting customers from around the world.

In conclusion, having exposure through a digital presence is more than just a modern trend; it's a strategic move that can significantly benefit businesses. It allows for broader reach, credibility, marketing opportunities, and adaptability in an increasingly digital world.Our initiative to help local businesses establish a digital presence is a commendable effort that can contribute to the growth and success of these businesses.
